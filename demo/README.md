# demo.voidbase.cloud

The public demo: a voidbase instance of its own, isolated from voidbase.cloud's, serving the unmodified PocketBase
admin panel at `/_/` and a framed copy of it with the credentials at `/`.

It is a **pb layout**, PocketBase's own structure, which is the point: nothing here is special to the site.

```
pb_hooks/demo-data.js   the schema (users, posts, messages, a messagesReport view) and the sample records
pb_hooks/demo.pb.js     seeds an empty database, restores everything on the hour, refuses file uploads
pb_secrets/main.ts      the deploy target and the published login, declared with defaults
pb_public/index.html    the banner and the frame around the panel
```

The database is restored every hour by a hook cron (`$app.importCollections` with `deleteMissing`, then
`truncateCollection` and a reseed), so a visitor may delete a collection, edit records or change the superuser
password and the next reset undoes it. File upload is refused because the bucket is public.

Run it locally:

```bash
bun run dev            # http://127.0.0.1:8095, panel at /_/
```

Deploy it (needs the deploy token in the environment or in `pb_secrets/secrets.json`):

```bash
bunx voidbase sync --name voidbase-demo --domain demo.voidbase.cloud
```

The target is named on the command line because the site's build environment carries its own
`VOIDBASE_DEPLOY_NAME`; without it the deploy refuses rather than putting the demo on the site's Worker. A push to
master does the same through Cloudflare Workers Builds (`bun run deploy:ci`).

Sign in with `test@example.com` / `demo123456`. The password is a demo secret in name only: it is printed on the
page, and every hour it goes back to this.
