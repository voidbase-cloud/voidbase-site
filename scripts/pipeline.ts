// `bun run build`, `bun run deploy`, `bun run version`: the three verbs Cloudflare Workers Builds calls, and the
// three a person calls by hand. What each one does is read from the environment (scripts/environment.ts), so the
// same word means the right thing in a build, on a branch and on a laptop, and the dashboard holds no logic:
//
//   build     the site into .voidbase/ (Vite with the voidbase adapter), then the typecheck. The same everywhere.
//   deploy    this instance, from the generated app. A person gets a build first, because nothing else has done
//             one; a build already has one. Off the production branch there is nothing to deploy. A build then
//             runs the provisioning smoke on what it deployed (test/cloud-live.ts --phase smoke): an instance is
//             created on the account, answers, takes a plugin and is deleted. A deploy that cannot provision
//             fails its build. A person opts in with VB_LIVE=1.
//   version   what a branch build leaves behind: the configuration this branch would deploy with, read back from
//             the declaration and the Worker. It changes nothing, so a branch cannot touch what is live.
//
// Nothing here supervises the commands it runs. A build that hangs or fails is the build platform's to time out and
// retry -- Cloudflare has a limit and a retry button.
