// What this run is, read from the environment rather than told.
//
// Twelve-factor III says config lives in the environment and is read as *granular controls*, never as a named
// environment ("dev", "staging", "prod"): each variable answers one question, and a deploy nobody anticipated still
// behaves correctly because it answers the same questions. So nothing here asks "which environment is this?" -- it
// asks whether a build is running this, which branch it is for, which branch is production, and whether the
// credentials for a deploy are present. Every answer has a default that is right for a laptop.
//
//   WORKERS_CI_BUILD_UUID, WORKERS_CI   a Cloudflare Workers build is running this (voidbase's CI makes the same test)
